Meet Neo, my very first theme! The core inspiration came from an acrylic box I made â€“ its deep, mesmerizing blue was too captivating not to use as the main background for Antinote. Contrasting this depth are vibrant accents inspired by the electric, glowing aesthetic of Tron and futuristic tech. Using Neo makes me feel like I'm plugged directly into the Matrix (hence the name ;)), navigating lines of code or notes in a cool, immersive digital world. Hope you enjoy it!
