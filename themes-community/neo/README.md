# Neo ✨

Meet **Neo**, my very first theme!

The core inspiration came from an acrylic box I made – its deep, mesmerizing blue was too captivating not to use as the main background for **Antinote**. Contrasting this depth are vibrant accents inspired by the electric, glowing aesthetic of **Tron** and futuristic tech.

Using Neo makes me feel like I'm plugged directly into the **Matrix** (hence the name ;)), navigating lines of code or notes in a cool, immersive digital world. Hope you enjoy it!
