# Dot Matrix
*A theme inspired by the old school DMG!*

The original *Dot Matrix Game* display uses 4 different shades of green to display color & shading. As an enthusiast of all things retro, I thought this would be a fun theme to sort of "test the waters" with Antinote's theme editor!
*I let myself use a few more shades of green, just so it wasn't a complete confusing visual mess. But the vibe is still there* ðŸ¤«

This probably isn't the most practical (or pretty) theme for long-term serious use, more of a simple concept/inspiration.
I intend to make a lot more themes inspired by consoles/games!
